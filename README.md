## âœ¨ How It Works

- **Data Preprocessing**: Reads and label-encodes the car dataset.
- **Model Selection**: Choose from pre-defined algorithms (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, etc.).
- **Prediction**: User inputs are processed to predict the car class (e.g., Accurate, Good).
- **Visualization**: Performance metrics and predictions are displayed in the web interface.
